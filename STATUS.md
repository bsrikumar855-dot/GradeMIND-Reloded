# STATUS

Current phase: **Phase 0b: STOP at gate, waiting for owner review** ([PHASE_0B_REPORT.md](PHASE_0B_REPORT.md)). All tables are generated; the GT basis is
**AGENT_VERIFIED** (D17), so silent-error and autocorrection results are not evidence. Owner decisions: [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). Phase 0 results:
[PHASE_0_REPORT.md](PHASE_0_REPORT.md), [docs/OCR_SPIKE.md](docs/OCR_SPIKE.md).

No application code exists yet (spec §23: no scaffolding before the OCR spike is approved). Everything below is **spike tooling** under
`spike/`, not product code.

## Implemented and tested

- `spike/score.py`: CER/WER, critical-token recall, and autocorrect candidates. It refuses unverified ground truth unless `--allow-draft`
  is given (then the output is stamped NOT_REPORTABLE). Self-test: identity gives CER 0, and an injected digit error and a spelling autocorrection are detected (commit `cb3d906`).
- Engine A degenerate-output detector (`spike/engine_a/degenerate.py`, stdlib). **Tested** by `spike/tests/test_degenerate_checks.py`:
  8 rules fire on real-page fixtures, with 0 false positives on 31 reviewed-clean pages (`uvx --from pytest==9.1.1 pytest spike/tests -q -rs`:
  `9 passed, 4 skipped`). The 4 skipped rules have **no real-page fixture yet** (TRUNCATED_AT_MAX_LENGTH, REPEATED_LINE, EMPTY_OUTPUT,
  ALL_REGIONS_EMPTY). The fixtures are gitignored student data, so CI cannot run these tests yet (owner decision pending).
- `spike/score.py` v2 (omissions, label P/R, option letters, spurious digits). Self-tested on sheet_001 drafts: identity gives perfect scores on all
  metrics, and injected faults are all detected (commit `1808074`).

- `spike/stats.py` (Wilson, page bootstrap, NOT_DISTINGUISHABLE): unit-tested. `make test`: 25 passed, 4 skipped, exit 0 (commit `1411815`).
- `spike/verify_ui/` transcription verifier: end-to-end self-test on a scratch copy (save lifecycle, whitelist, 400 on bad input). No automated test file.
- Rule-12 resolved-config assertions: smoke-tested; wrong weight hash -> exit 1 for Engines A and C.

- CI (GitHub Actions, `make test` on push): first run `37884412695` on `fd6c55d` passed: 25 passed, 4 skipped, exit 0. CI status is the source of truth (rule 13).

## Implemented but untested

- `spike/engine_a/run_engine_a.py` modes `int8` and `offload` (exercised on real pages, with no automated tests).
- `spike/engine_b/run_engine_b.py` (exercised on 27 pages, with no automated tests).
- `spike/run_spike.sh`, `spike/summarize.py`, `spike/run_phase0b.sh` (code snapshot per rule 9), `spike/report_0b.py`.
- `spike/preprocess/show_through.py` v0.1.0 (visually checked on 3 pages; effect measured in Phase 0b).
- `spike/engine_c/run_line_htr.py` (TrOCR line reader; smoke-tested on 1 page).
- `spike/engine_a/run_engine_a_vllm.py` (vLLM client): **Implemented, untested at scale.** It ran 16 pages before the server OOM'd (OCR_SPIKE A7). Kept per D2.

## Not implemented

- Everything in [docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md](docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md) §3–§20 (application, API, DB, UI, ScoreComputer, invariants I1–I12).
